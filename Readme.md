# Module 10 Lesson 3: Assignments | JavaScript Arrays and Strings
1. Exploring Array Manipulation in JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with various array manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including adding and removing elements, transforming arrays, and applying array methods.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that demonstrates different array manipulation operations. The program should cover adding and removing elements, sorting arrays, applying array methods such as map, filter, and reduce, and exploring the spread and rest operators.

Task 1: Adding and Removing Elements

Create an array containing some initial elements.
Use the push method to add a new element to the end of the array.
Use the pop method to remove the last element from the array.
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
Task 2: Sorting Arrays

Create an array of numbers in random order.
Use the sort method to sort the array in ascending order.
let numbers = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4];
Task 3: Applying Array Methods

Create an array of numbers.
Use the map method to double each number in the array.
Use the filter method to filter out even numbers from the array.
Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
let numbers = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4];
Expected Outcomes: Upon completion of this assignment, students should gain a thorough understanding of array manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including adding and removing elements, sorting arrays, and applying array methods such as map, filter, and reduce. They should also be familiar with using the spread and rest operators for array manipulation.

2. Exploring String Manipulation in JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to acquaint students with various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including string length, case conversion, substring extraction, and string splitting.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that demonstrates different string manipulation operations. The program should cover obtaining the length of a string, converting cases (upper and lower), extracting substrings, and splitting strings based on a delimiter.

Task 1: Obtaining String Length - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `length` property to obtain the length of the string.

let message = "Hello, World!";
Expected Outcome: Students should be able to understand how to determine the length of a string in JavaScript.

Task 2: Converting Cases - Create a string with mixed-case content. - Use the `toUpperCase` method to convert the string to uppercase. - Use the `toLowerCase` method to convert the string to lowercase.

let text = "Hello, World!";
Expected Outcome: Students should be able to demonstrate the ability to convert strings between uppercase and lowercase in JavaScript.

Task 3: Extracting Substrings - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `substring` method to extract a substring from the original string.

let sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
Expected Outcome: Students should be able to extract substrings from a given string using the `substring` method in JavaScript.

Task 4: Splitting Strings - Create a string containing multiple words separated by spaces. - Use the `split` method to split the string into an array of words based on the space delimiter.

let sentence = "The quick brown fox";
Expected Outcome: Students should be able to split a string into an array of substrings using the `split` method in JavaScript. Upon completion of this assignment, students should be proficient in various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including obtaining string length, converting cases, extracting substrings, and splitting strings. They should also understand when and how to apply these techniques in practical programming scenarios.

NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your HTML file that is linked to your JavaScript file, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, console.logs, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your JavaScript file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
